# Classification-of-iris-species-using-Machine-Learning
This project is based on the classification of iris flower into 3 species(iris-setosa,iris-versicolor and iris-verginica) using Machine Learning Algorithms.

# I have used Logistic Regression,Decision Tree Classfier,K Nearest Neighbors,Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Classification to predict the output i.e the species which the iris flower belongs to.
The data set is imported from UCI repository.
