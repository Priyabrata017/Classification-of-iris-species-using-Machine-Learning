# Classification-of-iris-species-using-Machine-Learning
This project is based on the classification of iris flower into 3 species(iris-setosa,iris-versicolor and iris-verginica) using Machine Learning Algorithms.

#I have used Logistic Regression,Decision Tree Clasisfier,K Nearest Neighbors,Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Classification.
The data set is imported from UCI repository.
